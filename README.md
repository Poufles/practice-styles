So you are reading this.
Well, I guess you got interested in my works or my old works (idk since as of writing this, I am still new).
This repo publicly shows my practice works of components. Trying to figure out how to do them or how they work.
Also, they are mostly CSS and some frameworks that I copy-pasted (OF COURSE).
But I am certain that most of these practice works are original and my own understanding.
Lastly, I am letting this publicly open for everyone to learn and copy-paste in their own works.
So, they are all free (one can say) since I learned everything for free. I am just giving back to the community :P
